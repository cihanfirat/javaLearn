The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a sequence of processing elements (handlers) to decide whether to handle a request or pass it along to the next handler in the chain. This pattern decouples senders and receivers, promoting a flexible way to process requests dynamically.

        Key Characteristics of Chain of Responsibility
Request Handling: Requests pass sequentially through a chain of handlers until one of them processes it.
Dynamic Composition: The chain can be structured or reorganized dynamically at runtime.
Decoupled Components: The client that sends the request does not need to know which handler processes it.

        Components of Chain of Responsibility

Handler (Abstract Class or Interface):

Declares a method to handle requests.
Defines a reference to the next handler in the chain.

Concrete Handlers:
Implement request handling logic.
Either process the request or pass it to the next handler.

Client:
Creates the chain and sends requests through it.

        When to Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern
        
When multiple objects may handle a request, and the handler isn't known in advance.
When you want to issue requests without specifying the receiver explicitly.
When you want to add flexibility to the order and logic of processing.
