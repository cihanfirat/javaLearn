The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. Using this pattern, you can add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

        Key Characteristics
Separation of Concerns: Visitors encapsulate operations that are performed on an object structure, keeping the logic outside of the objects.
Double Dispatch: Ensures that the operation executed depends both on the visitor type and the concrete element type.

        Benefits
Open/Closed Principle: Add new operations without changing the object structure.
Separation of Concerns: Object behavior is defined in visitors, leaving elements focused on data.
Clear Extensibility: Visitors provide a clear way to extend functionality.

        Components of Visitor Pattern
Visitor (Interface):
Defines a method for visiting each type of concrete element in the structure.

Concrete Visitor:
Implements operations to be performed on elements.

Element (Interface):
Declares an accept method for the visitor.

Concrete Element:
Objects that can be visited. These objects implement the accept method.
