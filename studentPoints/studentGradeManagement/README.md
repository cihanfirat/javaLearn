            - 10.05.2024 -> v1

1. Project Description
The Student Grade Management System is a console-based application designed to manage student information, including their names and grades. This project allows users to perform various operations such as adding students, assigning grades, displaying student information, and identifying the top-performing student based on average grades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Objectives
To implement a simple and effective system for managing student grades.
To practice object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, abstraction, reusability, modularity, data security, and ease of expansion.
To provide a user-friendly interface for users to manage student data efficiently.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Key Features
* Add Student: Users can add new students by entering their names.
* Add Grade: Users can assign grades to existing students.
* Display Students: A summary of all students along with their average grades can be displayed.
* Show Top Performer: The system can identify and display the student with the highest average grade.
* Exit: Users can exit the application gracefully.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Technical Requirements
* Programming Language: Java
* Development Environment: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or text editor with command-line compilation.
JDK Version: JDK 8 or higher.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Design and Architecture
The project follows an object-oriented design with the following components:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Classes:

* Student: Represents individual students, encapsulating their names and grades, and providing methods to manage this data.
* StudentGradeManager: The main class that handles user interactions, manages a list of students, and performs operations based on user input.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Implementation Details
* Encapsulation: Student attributes (name and grades) are encapsulated within the Student class, ensuring data security and integrity.
* Abstraction: The implementation details of grade management are hidden from users, exposing only necessary methods (e.g., addGrade, getAverageGrade).
* Modularity: The project is divided into separate files for clarity, making it easier to manage and maintain.
* Ease of Expansion: The design allows for future enhancements, such as adding more features (e.g., additional student attributes, grade weighting) without significant refactoring.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. User Interaction
The application operates through a text-based menu system, guiding users to select desired operations. Users interact with the program via keyboard input, making it straightforward to use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Future Enhancements
* User Authentication: Implement user authentication for secure access.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI to enhance user experience.
* Data Persistence: Integrate a database or file system to save student records, allowing data to persist across sessions.
* Weighting Grades: Allow grades to have different weights based on assignments, quizzes, and exams.
