Adapter Design Pattern: This pattern is used to make the interface of one class compatible with the interface of another class. In other words, it enables two incompatible components to work together by converting an object to an interface that the client expects.

When to use
* Integrate third-party libraries or APIs with different interfaces into the application.

* Make an old system work with a new system.

* Extend existing systems without rewriting or modifying the code.
